          Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didn’t know how she was going to make it.
          She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed.
          Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire.
          Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot. 
          He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter.

        The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing. After twenty minutes he turned off the burners.
        He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup.
        Turning to her, he asked. “Daughter, what do you see?” “Potatoes, eggs and coffee,” she hastily replied.
        “Look closer” he said, “and touch the potatoes.” She did and noted that they were soft.

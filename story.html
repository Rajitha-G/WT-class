          Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didnâ€™t know how she was going to make it.
          She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed.
          Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire.
          Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot. 
          He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter.

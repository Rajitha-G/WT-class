          Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father
          that her life was miserable and that she didn’t know 
          <br>
          how she was going to make it.She was tired of fighting and
          struggling all the time.It seemed just as one problem
          <br>
           was solved,another one soon followed.

        Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire.
        Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot.

         He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word
         to his daughter.The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited,
          <br>
         wondering what he was doing. After twenty minutes he turned
         off the burners.He took the potatoes out of the pot and
          <br>
         placed them in a bowl.He pulled the eggs out and placed 
         them in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed

          it in a cup.Turning to her,he asked.

        She did and noted that they were soft.He then asked her to take 
       an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the 
        <br>
       hard-boiled egg.Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face.gyytdtrdtydty

          He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity-the boiling water. 
           However, each one reacted differently. The potato went in strong, hard and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak.

                 The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior 
                 until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard.
                 However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the 
                 boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.

       In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is how you choose to react to it and what you make out of it.

        Life is all about leaning, adopting and converting all the struggles that we experience into something positive.
